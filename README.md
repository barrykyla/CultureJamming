# The Home Page

***
This is the first ever HTML coding I have done. Our main goals of this project were to 
just play around with HTML and CSS to generate a homepage that represented us. I played
around with the background as well as the color and style of the font. Overall I tried 
to create something that was not only playful but had a cohesive manner.
